<p>Hi, I was born in Rwanda a small Country in East Africa, when I was very young my entire family had to move D.R. Congo due war in Rwanda. We stayed there for a while, did my primary school and High school where I learned Electricity and two more local languages which helped me a lot to integrate and be comfortable  in most of the place traveled too when I was much  older.   By that time my dad had save enough money for my three siblings and I to college.</p>
<p>We went back to Rwanda where I started my journey in to technology and computer world for four years, after three years of school I got offered to work at the University as an IT support and instructor and I find myself enjoying it. Every day was a new and a good experience for me because I was doing what I loved and beyond that I had the opportunity to share my knowledge with other by assisting and teach them about computer and how to use it.</p>
<p>Few months later I was in Texas by myself with only one friend who hosted me for a while before get myself together. My goal was to get here and go back to school and focus in one area of computer science which is programming then pursue my career in web and software development but life happened I had to support my family at one point and for I had to work hard every day until when things went back to normal for my family. I was doing small jobs then when I was more comfortable and getting to know people, I decide to look for a decent job my friend suggested me to work in construction where I was doing inspections on construction sites. I didn’t really like the job but I had pay bills then the pandemic came and that’s when I got some time to think about my future and my goals. </p>
<p>Me having a lot time on my hands I had to figure out what to do next, I started by looking for IT boot camps, I found one but I had to move to Washington DC to attend the training but after couple month I wasn’t feeling like I was learning much so I came back to Texas where I an old friend from Rwanda told me about Maharishi University where he just about to finish his Masters in computer science. He told me about how you gain not only knowledge but also a personal growth, I was interested and that how I end up here, where I hope to finish my education and personal growth to enjoy what life had the offer and  bring my contribution to my community and to the society.</p>
